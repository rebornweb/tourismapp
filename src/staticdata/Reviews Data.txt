But the standard room, bathroom and beds are very cool but really small, even for Tokyo, given the price. If you plan on relaxing in your room for any period of time this is probably not the place for you, but good as a city bolt hole in a good location. Be warned that comments about weddings overrunning the hotel are true, it didn‚Äôt bother us because we didn‚Äôt spend much time at the hotel but it was chaos in the lobby and bar with wedding guests lunch time and early evening on the weekend.",

There are very cool, well dressed people working in the lobby at all times, and a DJ at night. We liked the opportunity for a scene in the hotel, but it may not be for everyone. \n\nThe staff were incredibly kind and helpful, both before and during our visit. The room was compact but very comfortable, clean, and efficient. We loved having a balcony for some fresh air and additional space. \n\nWe only ate at the bar, but loved the fries with all the toppings. And the drinks were excellent. We will definitely stay at this little oasis the next time we're in Tokyo. ",

Notable places: Streamer (the BEST coffee around‚Ä¶not to mention their red velvet cheesecake brownie) , SHIbuichi bakery for delicious hot out of the oven breakfast bagels, croissants, kaarage chocken sandwiches & baked goods. For dinner do not miss Kushi just by the hotel entrance. Delicious rice dishes, yakitori & curry-they also do a deal offering a free glass of wine to hotel guests with your order. Menchirashi udon noodles ALWAYS had a queue & Yai Yai okonomiyaki was delicious. Do not miss The Little bakery Tokyo for the most delicious gourmet cakes, sandwiches & baked goods around.

Upon arrival, they carried our luggage to the room. They personally escorted us around the building grounds then up to our room and answered any questions we might‚Äôve had, very cute touch. \n\nThe night and morning bartenders were the stars of the show. They had no issue working up beautiful and delicious off-menu cocktails. \n\nBreakfast was light, flavorful, and filling. Perfect before our long flight home. \n\nThe rooms were quant, very clean, and had a nice boutique vibe. Out of the 5 premium hotel/ryukan‚Äôs we stayed at, none had much in the way of clothing storage. I assume it could be a cultural difference. Regardless, that did not take away from our experience. \n\nIt was a beautiful and warm way to end an above and beyond vacation!",
