So many restaurants around the hotel. Buffet breakfast on offer as well.",

The Hotel Diana. Price was awsome and included free parking. \nArrived to a super warm greeting for the lady behind the desk. Room was ready even though we arrived early. Room modern, fresh, super clean. \nHotel 10min easy walk to Southbank. Great eateries local to the hotel itself so not necessary to go to southbank if you don't need to. Breakfast reasonably priced and well presented. \nOnly negative, there is no pool but southbank has all the swimming facilities you would need.\nNice gym for the fitness gurus.\nDon't spend hundreds on other hotels in the area. Try this one first.",

We had a king room on the 3rd floor.  The room was not large but very well appointed, comfortable and very clean.  There were wine glass in the room, small fridge, and coffee/tea making facilities, including an occasional chair and table for sitting at.  The bathroom was a tile and the shower had great pressure.  The front desk staff were very friendly and always greeted us when we passed by.  The location of the hotel is nice, less than  5 min walk to the south bank and adjacent to the Brisbane Brewing Company pub and some food court type restaurants.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Brisbane, as the service, quality and location was great value for the price paid!",
